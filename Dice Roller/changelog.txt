	Quickly created six images and created code to bind the enter key to a definition called Roll which generates a pseudorandom number between 1 and 6 (Inclusive) and from there it reads a list and extrapolates the directory of the correct image and creates a set of variables based upon this. It then displays the correct image showing the user what number was pseudorandomly generated. This is then presented in a looping window that provides access to debugging tools and a simple user inteface for the user. Very similar, repeating code have been replaced with a for loop to decrease code size, keep it neat and professional.
